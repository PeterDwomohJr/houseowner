PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT:

The purpose of the project is to enable aspiring house owners to buy a land or house
without a fear of being defrauded. It provides an easy and surest way to buy a land or house
where all the transactions are handled on the platform. 


CONTRIBUTORS:

1. Kwadwo Dwomo II


HOW IT WORKS:

When the user of the project opens the software, she has two roles to play. 
The first role is that of a legitimate land or house owner who wants to sell. 
The second role is that of a land or house buyer. The legitimate land or 
house owner must provide land title (which is verified by the land's commission)
before she is allowed to successfully post a land or house to sell.
When a land has been successfully published on houseowner, the buyer sees it
and has the opportunity to bid on the land. The bidding is public and transparent
so that other potential buyers can see the history of the negotiation.
This means the platform disallows both parties from sharing any information
that will enable them to talk outside the platform. When the seller is satisfied
with the proposed price, the buyer is entreated to make payment on the platform
at which point the money is transferred to the company's bank account.
After the buyer has made the payment, the platform starts the process
of changing the ownership of the land to the buyer with the aid of the land's commission. 
If the change of ownership is successful, the money is transferred to the seller.
After the transaction is complete, the platform deletes the land from the database.
It must be noted that the platform charges 10% of the total transaction cost.
